      The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket developed and manufactured by SpaceX.
      It is the company's workhorse rocket and is designed for both satellite
      launches and cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station
      (ISS). The first stage of the Falcon 9 is powered by nine Merlin engines,
      while the second stage uses one Merlin Vacuum engine. Both stages use a
      combination of liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1)
      propellants. The first stage is reusable and can land either on a drone
      ship in the ocean or on land, allowing for cost savings and multiple
      launches. The Falcon 9 has been successfully launching and deploying
      various satellites into orbit since its maiden launch in 2010. It has also
      been utilized by NASA for cargo resupply missions to the ISS as part of
      the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program. In addition to these
      missions, SpaceX has used the Falcon 9 to launch the company's own
      Starlink satellites for building a global broadband internet
      constellation. The Falcon 9 also serves as the platform for launching the
      Crew Dragon spacecraft with astronauts on board for NASA's Commercial Crew
      Program. Overall, the Falcon 9 has significantly impacted the space
      industry by demonstrating reusable rocket technology and enabling more
      affordable and frequent access to space.

      The Falcon 9 Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle
      developed by SpaceX. It is an upgraded version of the Falcon 9 rocket and
      is currently the most powerful operational rocket in the world. The Falcon
      9 Heavy consists of three Falcon 9 first stages strapped together, forming
      a total of 27 Merlin engines that produce over 5 million pounds of thrust
      at liftoff. This allows it to carry large payloads to orbit, including
      satellites and potentially even crewed missions to the Moon or Mars in the
      future. The most notable achievement of the Falcon 9 Heavy was its
      successful launch of the Falcon Heavy Test Flight in February 2018, where
      it became the first operational rocket to have such a high payload
      capacity.
